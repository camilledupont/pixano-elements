# organisation/repository management
## opensource version published on github
- [repository](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements) opensource under licence [CeCILL-C](./LICENSE.txt)
- contains all modules and codes from SoTA
- version tags : vX.Y.Z
- **never push directly on the github !** You must always go through pull-requests to secure and generate traffic (see [procedure](#procedure-de-publication)).

## internal version published on our gitlab
### remote github branch
- this branch is a local copy of the github repository **fork√©**. It is only used to prepare and do publications (or more rarely to retrieve github code if it is ahead  on the gitlab master).
- for each new version to publish on the github :
	- you prepare it on this branch
	- you test it on this branch
	- you tag it on this branch
	- you push it on your forked github before doing a oull-request on the original repository (see [detailed procedure](#procedure-de-publication))
### master branch
- default branch to retrieve for all new user
- version the most up-to-date, it contains, more than the github functionnalities, all smart functions usable internally and with our partners
- regroup "regularly" the project novelties (except for porjet code which stay proprietary for given company)
- version tags : viX.Y.Z
### other branches
- one branch per project (industrial, thesis, internship)
- each branch comes from master
- all functionnalities or corrections mature enough are push "regularly" on the master (merge or cherry-pick depending on the case)
- at the end of the project, the branch is fused with the master
- version tags (if appropriate) : vipX.Y.Z or specific tag for the partner (eg. vipX.Y.Z_arcure, vipX.Y.Z_valeo, etc)

### schematically :
```
github                                      gitlab  
------                     ---------------------------------------  
                                                               <--merge--> p1  
master  <----pull-request----  github <--cherry-picks-- master <--merge--> p2  
                                                               <--merge--> p2  



                                                               <--merge--> p1  
master  ------- pull ------->  github  --- merge --->   master <--merge--> p2  
                                                               <--merge--> p2  
```

## particular case of a repository which must be in tuleap
- the developments linked to the project are done on the tuleap by both the cea and the partners
- push "regularly" novelties from tuleap to the project branch in gitlab
- push "regularly" novelties from the gitlab to the tuleap depending on the need, procedure :
	1. push tuleap to gitlab (project)
	2. merge gitlab master and project branches
	3. push gitlab (project) to tuleap

*We mean by "regularly" : every about 6 months, ideally in september and january. You are of course free to do these merges more often.*

# Open-source publication procedure
## Prerequisite (only the first time)
#### have a github account and fork
- create a [github](https://github.com) $MYACCOUNT account 
- create a fork of the [original repository](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements)
#### initialize the repository remote branch
	git remote add upstream git@github.com:$MYACCOUNT/pixano-elements.git
	git fetch upstream
	git checkout -b github upstream/master
#### clone the web landing page
	cd .. ; git clone git@github.com:pixano/pixano.github.io.git ; cd -

## Publication
### 1) Prepate the publication
1. On github : Update your fork
	- on your fork github (on github.com), click on "Fetch upstream", then "Fetch and merge"
2. Locally:

		# make sure the repositories are up-to-date
		git fetch
		git fetch upstream
		git checkout github
		
		# integrate our modifications to the github branch
		# a few usage examples with cherry-pick :
		# import of the commit number d5e075f2 :
		git cherry-pick d5e075f2
		# import of all commits from b4cb0b18 to d5e075f2 both included:
		git cherry-pick b4cb0b18^..d5e075f2
		# import of all commits from cfbb3866 (not included) to 74e276acb:
		git cherry-pick cfbb3866..74e276acb

During the merge / before commiting, **do not include / delete files and internal/proprietary codes** :  

- do not include the present file [README_INTERNE.md](./README_INTERNE.md), nor the .gitlab-ci.yml
- do not include the folder [doc_interne](./doc_interne)
- do not include the files with tag "proprietary"
- do not include with code blocks surrounded by tag "proprietary"

### 2) Verify and validate code
#### clean and recompile "from scratch"
	# clean
	rm -rf node_modules
	rm package-lock.json
	rm -rf packages/*/node_modules
	# compile
	npm i
	npm run bootstrap
	npm run build
#### verify "by hand"
	npx serve demos/cuboid/
	npx serve demos/polygon/
	npx serve demos/graph/
	npx serve demos/segmentation/
	npx serve demos/smart-segmentation/
	npx serve demos/rectangle/
	npx serve demos/smart-rectangle/
	npx serve demos/tracking/
#### finalisation/code clean
- code review
- clean code: `npm run tslint`

### 3) Publish
#### 1. push
	VERSION=0.5.16
	# update the publication version
	node changeversion.js $VERSION
	git add package.json */*/package.json
	git commit -m "release $VERSION"
	git tag -m "v$VERSION" "v$VERSION"
	# push modifications on the fork
	git push upstream github:master --follow-tags

	# tag report on master
	git checkout master
	#OR git checkout f5f56daf if the reference commit is not the last one
	node changeversion.js $VERSION
	git add package.json */*/package.json
	git tag -m "vi$VERSION" "vi$VERSION"
	git push origin master --follow-tags
#### 2. pull-request
The rest is on [github](https://github.com) :

- on the fork $MYACCOUNT : onglet "Pull requests" => "New pull request" => "Create pull request" => "Create pull request"
- automatic verifications are made by github
- on the pixano account : got to "Merge pull request" => "Confirm merge"
#### 3. release
Transform the tag in github release (makes the last tag more visible and detailed) :
<!--	DOES NOT WORK (yet)?) because tags are not exported in pull requests-->
<!--	- go to the page [tags](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements/tags)-->
<!--	- select the last tag-->
<!--	- "Edit release"-->
<!--	- in "Release title", put the version vX.Y.Z-->
<!--	- "Update release"-->

	- go to the page in [release](https://github.com/pixano/pixano-elements/releases)
	- button "Draft a new release"
	- "Tag version" vX.Y.Z
	- in "Release title", put the version vX.Y.Z
	- complete the comments :
		- under the following form :
```
### nomModule (eg. graphics-2d)

* description commit 1
* description commit 2
* ...
```
		- To easily list the commits and descriptions :
			git log v0.5.15..v0.5.16 --oneline
	- "Publish release"
	
#### 4. publication npm
	# if not logged already
	# contact pixano@cea.fr for more information
	npm run build:umd
	npm login
	npm publish packages/core
	npm publish packages/ai
	npm publish packages/graphics-2d
	npm publish packages/graphics-3d

#### 5. publication of the documentation
	npm run docs
	rm -r ../pixano.github.io/docs ; cp -r docs ../pixano.github.io/docs
	cd ../pixano.github.io/
	git commit -a -m "release $VERSION"
	git tag -m "v$VERSION" "v$VERSION"
	git push --follow-tags

---------------------

# Update gitlab code from github open-source repo
## update your fork with respect to the github
- on your fork github, press on "Fetch upstream", then "Fetch and merge"

## retrieve and fuse modifications
	# update the remote repository
	git fetch
	git fetch upstream
	git checkout github
	git pull
	# fuse
	git checkout master
	git merge github
	# in case of conflicts
	git mergetool
	# once everything is verified and validated => finalisation
	git commit
	git push origin master

---------------------

# developping rules
- the proprietary functionalities (do **not** report on the github) must be well identified : seperated file each time it is possible or at least a well defined code block
- internal documentation (do **not** report on the github) is separated from the public documentation : it is stored in the folder [doc_interne](./doc_interne) and file [README_INTERNAL.md](./README_INTERNAL.md)
- the public documentation is written only for the github users and must not reference to any internal function.

## tag example to put at the beginning of each proprietary file
